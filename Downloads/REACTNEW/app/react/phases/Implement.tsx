      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-700"> Implement & Transfer – 1 to 3 Months</h3>
        
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
              This is where your solution leaves the sketchbook and enters the soil, the system, the hands of the people who need it most. The <strong>Implement</strong> phase is not just deployment—it's refinement, resilience, and readiness for the real world.
            </p>
        
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
              Whether you’re field-testing a tool, co-building with a sponsor, or preparing for long-term impact, this phase helps you <strong>finalize, document, protect, and share</strong> your work—ethically and accessibly.
            </p>
        
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-green-700 mt-6 mb-2">Iterative Testing & Refinement</h4>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
              Implementation begins with small-scale trials. You place your solution into the environment it was built for—and let it speak back to you. You watch how it behaves, how people respond, and what breaks down.
            </p>
        
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
              <li><strong>Prototype Deployment:</strong> Release your working solution in a real context.</li>
              <li><strong>User Testing:</strong> Collect data and feedback from direct use, observation, and dialogue.</li>
              <li><strong>Refine:</strong> Identify what’s working and where friction still exists—then adjust.</li>
              <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Iterate until the solution is stable, safe, and context-appropriate.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p className="text-gray-700 italic mb-6">
              Implementation isn’t a final step—it’s the beginning of a feedback loop.
            </p>
        
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-green-700 mb-2">Documentation & Intellectual Property</h4>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
              As your solution takes form, so must your record of it. You’ll begin building a clear and sharable archive of your process, decisions, iterations, and learnings.
            </p>
        
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
              <li><strong>Document Design:</strong> Structure the journey from idea to implementation (drawings, logs, journals).</li>
              <li><strong>IP Filing (if applicable):</strong> Work with your mentor or legal counsel to file patents, copyrights, or trademarks.</li>
              <li><strong>Open Publishing:</strong> Share your learnings and frameworks for others to replicate or build upon.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              IP protection is not about ownership. It’s about <strong>ensuring your work remains accessible, ethical, and attributed</strong>—especially when others want to scale it.
            </p>
        
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-green-700 mb-2">Industry Partnerships & Commercialization</h4>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
              Some solutions will remain grassroots. Others may scale—with support. When working with an industry sponsor, this phase becomes a shared journey. You’ll explore how to develop, manufacture, distribute, or maintain your solution with real-world systems.
            </p>
        
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
              <li><strong>Align values:</strong> Ensure the partner understands your goals—social, ecological, or systemic.</li>
              <li><strong>Map responsibilities:</strong> Who builds what? Who funds what? Who owns what?</li>
              <li><strong>Co-develop strategy:</strong> Build together toward a sustainable, scalable form of the solution.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              If your solution reaches commercialization, this phase includes defining your <strong>business model, user pipeline, cost structure, and manufacturing roadmap</strong>—with guidance from both mentors and industry partners.
            </p>
        
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 italic mb-6">
              The goal of implementation isn’t just reach. It’s repeatability, responsibility, and readiness for the world beyond you.
            </p>
        
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Your final implementation can take many forms: a working prototype in use, a policy brief adopted by a village council, a startup-ready MVP, or a published, protected toolkit available for free access.
            </p>
        
            <p className="text-base text-gray-700 italic">
              Implement is where your solution stops being yours—and becomes something others can live with, build on, and carry forward.
            </p>
