      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-800">🌿 Live the Life – 30 Days</h3>

<p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
  What if your classroom had no walls? What if your teacher was the land, the weather, the people—and every choice they make to survive and thrive? That’s what <strong>Live the Life</strong> is all about.
</p>

<p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
  For 30 days, you don’t just visit a community—you become a part of it. Whether it’s waking up at 4:30 AM to milk the cows, bargaining in the local market, repairing broken irrigation pipes, or listening to stories over firewood dinners—you <em>live the everyday</em>. And in doing so, you start seeing what most people miss: the friction points, the workarounds, the invisible systems at play.
</p>

<p className="text-lg text-gray-800 italic mb-6">
There are seasons in a life where you don’t study the world—you enter it.<br/>
You sleep under its breath, walk through its silence, and work with its weight.<br/>
Not to master it. But to understand what it asks of you.
</p>

<p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
REACT is that season. Not a course. Not a curriculum. A crossing.
</p>

<p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
Here, you live among the questions—not answer them. You let mud stain your palms and conversations shape your mind. You observe systems not in diagrams, but in the pace of a morning, the choice of a tool, the curve of a shared path.
</p>

<p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
It is not light. And yet, it is. Because what burdens the mind lightens the self when carried with purpose.
</p>

<p className="text-base text-gray-700">
This is where learning stops rehearsing—and begins to live.
</p>

<p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
  This isn’t a field visit. This is full immersion. You aren’t a tourist—you’re a temporary citizen. And that changes everything.
</p>

<p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
  You document your observations—not as a researcher, but as someone who belongs. You journal, film, photograph, sketch, talk, and most importantly—<strong>listen</strong>. This phase isn’t about fixing anything yet. It’s about noticing everything.
</p>

<p className="mb-4 text-center italic font-medium text-indigo-700">
  “We can’t change a world we haven’t walked in. So we walk in it. Fully.”
</p>

<p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
  Explore is your entry into a life you’ve never lived—and possibly, never truly understood. It’s raw. It’s real. And it opens your eyes like no lecture ever could.
