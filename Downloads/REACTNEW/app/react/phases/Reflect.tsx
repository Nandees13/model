  <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
    Some things don‚Äôt make sense in the moment. Only when you step back, sit still, and listen again‚Äîdo they begin to speak. That‚Äôs what <strong>Reflect</strong> is for. After living the life, you let it breathe through you one more time. This time, slower. This time, with intention.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
    You return not just with stories, but with tension. With something unresolved. Something that stayed with you. This phase helps you hold that feeling long enough to ask:
  </p>

  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
    <li>Why did this moment matter more than others?</li>
    <li>What caused this problem to exist?</li>
    <li>Who is affected‚Äîand how do they see it?</li>
    <li>What has already been tried?</li>
    <li>Is this a problem that needs to be solved‚Äîor understood differently?</li>
  </ul>

  <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 italic mb-6">
    Reflection is not a pause in the journey. It‚Äôs the part where you decide where to go next.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Here, you study not books‚Äîbut the systems you lived inside. You map relationships, visualize impact chains, trace decisions across time. It‚Äôs a time for silence, systems, and synthesis.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
    With mentor support, you‚Äôll eventually choose one challenge to carry forward‚Äînot the loudest one, but the one that‚Äôs asking for you. The one you understand both emotionally and structurally. And from that, you‚Äôll begin shaping it into a <strong>problem statement</strong>, a <strong>research hypothesis</strong>, or a <strong>design brief</strong>.
  </p>

  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
    But before you can solve anything, you must first understand what you‚Äôre solving‚Äîand why. That begins by turning your lived experience into insights worth acting on.
  </p>

  <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-yellow-700 mb-2">Part One: Insight Mining from Experience</h4>

  <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
    After 30 days of immersion, you carry memories, emotions, and observations. Insight Mining helps you transform these into clear, grounded, and meaningful problem statements.

  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
    <li><strong>Reconstruct your journey:</strong> Map out your days‚Äîwhat happened, who you met, what stood out.</li>
    <li><strong>Highlight tension points:</strong> Look for moments that felt frustrating, unfair, slow, or confusing.</li>
    <li><strong>Ask reflective questions:</strong> Why did this happen? Who was impacted? What system was involved?</li>
    <li><strong>Cluster recurring themes:</strong> Group moments into patterns‚Äîaround water, trust, time, access, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Draft raw problem statements:</strong> Use phrases like ‚ÄúI noticed that...‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow might we...‚Äù</li>
    <li><strong>Sense-check your insights:</strong> Share with mentors, peers, or locals to validate what you found.</li>
  </ul>

  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
    This process gives you not just a list of problems‚Äîbut problems that are personal, observed, and real.
  </p>

  <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-yellow-700 mb-2">Part Two: Shortlisting the Right Problem</h4>

  <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
    Once you have a list of potential problems, you need a method to choose the one to take forward. We use a structured scoring system to help you decide with clarity.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-2 text-gray-700 font-medium">Score each problem (1 to 5) across the following:</p>

  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
    <li>Is this a real and current issue in the community?</li>
    <li>Do I genuinely care about solving it?</li>
    <li>Can I address this within the next 3 to 12 months?</li>
    <li>Do I or my team have access to tools or skills for this?</li>
    <li>If solved, would it create meaningful impact?</li>
    <li>Does this align with what I want to grow or learn?</li>
  </ul>

  <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
    Add up the scores. Prioritize the top 2 or 3. Then choose the one that feels right‚Äînot just in numbers, but in your gut.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
    You can also draw a grid with effort on the X-axis and impact on the Y-axis. Aim for problems that fall in the high-impact, low-to-medium effort zone.
  </p>

  <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-yellow-700 mb-2">Visual Prioritization Matrix</h4>

<p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
Use this matrix to help visualize which problems are worth pursuing based on effort required and potential impact.

  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Ask yourself:
  </p>

  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
    <li>Which one can I commit to for the next few months?</li>
    <li>Which one feels urgent and meaningful?</li>
    <li>Which one aligns with my skills, my timeline, and my passion?</li>
  </ul>

  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
    Your final choice becomes the foundation for the Solve phase. It's not just a project. It‚Äôs your way of honoring the life you lived‚Äîand beginning to change it.

    Reflect is where immersion becomes insight. It‚Äôs where experience becomes direction. It‚Äôs where intention enters the equation.
